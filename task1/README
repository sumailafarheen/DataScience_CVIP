Phase 1 Normal Project

Project Name: Exploratory Data Analysis of Terrorism Dataset

Technologies used: Python Jupyter Notebook

IDE Used: Visual Studio Code

For my first assignment from CodersCave, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a terrorism dataset:

The project comprises of these following topics:

Dataset can be obtained from : www.kaggle.com
1) Understanding the Dataset: Started by gaining a high-level understanding of the dataset by looking at the dataset's structure and the data types of each column.

2) Handling the Missing Data: Identifying missing values in the dataset and deciding how to handle them. Depending on the amount and nature of missing data, I chose to drop the columns with null

values.

3) Visualizing the Data: Using plotting techniques to visualize the data and identify patterns, trends, or outliers.
